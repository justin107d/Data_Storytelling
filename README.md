Exploring the Social Security Administration Disability data.


In this data set I explore population trends broken down by region and even further down by state.  I wanted to see how population developed in different parts of the country and how the rate of disability changed with them. Charting the data exposed a few outliers in the population data that were not explained in the supporting information.  I also tried to see how correlated the regions were to each other.  All regions were highly correlated amongst themselves, but in each set, both the adult population data and the percentages of, showed one corelation that went against the broke the trend.  The most interesting finding from these graphs was that the percent of adults on disability was continuing upwards at a rate that seemed to roughly correlate with the growth in population.  Further research is required to decipher how these two are related by a third variable or coincidence.
